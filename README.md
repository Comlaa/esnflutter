# eSportskeNovosti - Flutter part

Hi everyone!

This is for my university project. This repository is only for Flutter and you can find the Windows Form and API part [here](https://github.com/Comlaa/eSportskeNovosti).

## Login data
Please run the project in the web browser since the endpoints are configured to be runned there and not on the emulator.

When you first run the project, you will see that the project has seed data. Here are 3 different users that you can test the application with. I suggest using 'korisnik' on the Flutter app and 'Desktop' on the Windows Forms one.

1. desktop, pw: test - Admin role
2. mobile, pw: test - Admin role
3. korisnik, pw: test - User role
