# eSportskeNovosti - Flutter part

Hi everyone!

This is for my university project. This repository is only for Flutter and you can find the Windows Form and API part [here](https://github.com/Comlaa/eSportskeNovosti).

## Login data
When you first run the project, you will see that the project has seed data. Here are 3 different users that you can test the application with. I suggest using 'korisnik' on the Flutter app and 'Desktop' on the Windows Forms one.

1. desktop, pw: test
2. mobile, pw: test
3. korisnik, pw: test
